###Analysis Tools

MATLAB scripts for analysis of data acquired using RTXI. 

The file contains several functions for loading data from an HDF file and it 
within MATLAB. Example use of the scripts is in a file called `example.m`. 
Load it and edit it as you need. Make sure the PATH variable is set to include 
the analysis-tools directory.  

Also, the data given to the scripts NEED to have PARAMETER-type variables 
defined.
